# Serkan Onal Bootstrap Portfolio

## Description

This Bootstrap portfolio project was created in order to provide people/ employers the ability to find out more information about myself and the work/ projects i have either created or collaborated on.

I have attempted to show case my ability using Bootstrap to complete this portfolio project and refrained from relying on CSS to build this project.

I have attempted to demonstrated my abilities in Bootstrap by creating this website which has clear/ concise layout, provides friendly user experience with navigatable links to specific sections of the website.

The website presents my projects and allows users the ability to view the source code/ repositories and active/ live site when the links are click on.

The website also encorporates a responsive design to allow users the ability to view it on different device screens. This was achieved using Bootstrap and using the bootstrap grids, container, flexboxes and break points to achieve this.

 Some considerations which i had to encoporate into my website beforehand and during the development. 

- ***Clean and consistant layout*** - To provide a clean website layout, which enables users to navigate the website and find relevant information.
- ***Navigation*** - Provide clear links to sections of the website with the use of a navigation bar.
- ***Present Projects/ Work*** - Provide a section of the website which will allow people the ability to view work which i have created or collaborated on. All bodies of work will allow users to view active/ live sites or repositories when click on.
- ***Responsive Design*** - Provide a website which is responsive, and can adjust/ adapt itself to different screen size.
- ***Interactive Design*** - Provide users with some interactive elements so they are able to have better user experience.
- ***Code Optimisation*** - Reduce the amount of repeated code within the website to make the website load faster and easier to understand for other developers. 
-***Relying on Bootstrap*** - Relying on boostrap framework/ library to achieve all of the points above and refrain from using CSS to achieve layout and design.
